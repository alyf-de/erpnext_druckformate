# Commit Message Instructions

- Use conventional commit message format.
- The commit message should have a `short description` (50 characters or less) followed by a blank line and then a `description`.
- The `short description` should be in the format: `<type>(<scope>):<icon> <summary>`
  - `type`: The type of change (e.g., feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore).
    - `feat`: ✨ A new feature. (Hint: There should be code files involved!)
    - `fix`: 🐛 A bug fix
    - `docs`: 📝 Documentation only changes
    - `style`: 💄 Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
    - `refactor`: ♻️ A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
    - `test`: ✅ Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
    - `chore`: 🔧 Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
    - `perf`: ⚡️ A code change that improves performance
    - `ci`: 👷 Changes to CI configuration files and scripts

    - `patch`: 🩹 Applying patches
    - `optimize`: 🛠️ Optimizing code

  - `scope`: The scope of the change (e.g., component or file name). Include this if the change is specific to a particular part of the codebase.

- `summary`: A brief summary of the change.

- The `description` should provide additional context and details about the change. Try to keep it short and concise, but it can be longer than the `short description`. It should:
  - Explain why the change was made.
  - Describe what is being used and why.
  - Include any relevant information that might be useful for understanding the change in the future.
  - Reference any related issues or pull requests at the end of the long description.
- If the commit fixes an issue or task, include `Close #<issue-number>` at the end of the long description.
- If the commit introduces a breaking change, include `BREAKING CHANGE: <description of the breaking change>` at the end of the `description`.
